# Library-Management-System

This is a simple python program that implements Simple Library Management System by using Object Oriented Concepts.

Three classes names Book,Member,Library are used to control the information of the books,library members and their details.

Methods like borrow_book,return_book,etc. are some of the important methods to define the work done in the library.
